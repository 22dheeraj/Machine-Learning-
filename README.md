# 🏠 Airbnb Price Prediction & Insights

## 📌 Overview
Airbnb is a global platform that allows property owners to rent out their spaces to travelers.  
Setting the **right price** for a listing is crucial for:
- Staying competitive
- Attracting bookings
- Maximizing revenue

This project focuses on building a **machine learning regression model** to predict the price of an Airbnb listing using features such as:
- Property type
- Room type
- Location
- Amenities
- Host characteristics

Alongside prediction, the project also delivers **data-driven insights** that hosts can use to optimize their pricing strategy.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Develop a **regression model** that predicts the nightly price of an Airbnb listing.  

The analysis aims to:
1. Identify the **key factors** that influence pricing.
2. Help hosts make **data-backed pricing decisions**.
3. Provide actionable insights for improving listing competitiveness.

## 📦 Project Deliverables

### **1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing **
- Explored dataset for patterns and trends.
- Identified and handled missing values and outliers.
- Performed feature engineering (e.g., number of amenities, neighborhood popularity).
- Applied transformations for model readiness.

### **2. Model Development **
- Trained and evaluated multiple regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - KNN Regression
  - Support Vector Machine(SVM)
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Compared models on **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²** scores.
- Selected the best-performing model for deployment.

### **3. Model Evaluation **
- Evaluated models on test set using:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - R² (Coefficient of Determination)
- Ensured selected model had a good balance between accuracy and generalization.

- **Model Comparison Table:**
